      <h1>Grizz Financial</h1>
      <p>Our mission for Grizz Financial is to help OU students learn to have good financial habits, as well as be
        able to make improved financial decisions for their future. Finances are a major stress for college
        students,
        especially during the time of a pandemic. Our goal with Grizz Financial is to create a way to alleviate this
        stress. With Grizz Financial, we aim to give students tools to understand how much of their money is being
        spent, as well as how much is being saved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our vision is to give students a complete understanding of their finances. In the near future we plan to
        implement a service that sends students weekly budget reports, as well as giving them financial advice
        curated
        specifically for them and their needs. Grizz Financial aims to take away the stress and confusion of
        finances
        that students have to deal with on top of their academic commitments. With many students also having to
        worry
        about paying off student loans, an application like Grizz Financial can aid them in learning how to save,
        and
        reduce unnecessary spending to perhaps help students in paying back their academic debt.
